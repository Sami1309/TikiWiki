# Wikipedia Scroller

A lightweight pure javascript application that lets you discover random Wikipedia articles, inspired by the tiktok procedural scroll interface.

Inspired by https://github.com/IsaacGemal/wikitok

## Features

### 1. Random Article Discovery
- **Infinite Scroll Up**: Pull (or scroll) up to fetch a brand-new, random Wikipedia article.

### 2. Category-Based Browsing
- **Swipe Left** (mobile) or **Right Arrow Click** (desktop) to open related articles from the same category.

## Roadmap

### Local Recommendations
- The local recommendation system will analyze your reading history and content preferences (if you allow).  
- All data stays on your device for privacy.

### Account-Based Recommendations
- A potential cloud-based recommendation feature will be introduced for users who choose to create an account.
- Allows cross-device synchronization and more personalized suggestions.
