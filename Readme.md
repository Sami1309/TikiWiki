# WikiScroll

A lightweight pure javascript application that lets you discover random Wikipedia articles, inspired by TikTok's procedural scrolling interface.

Inspired by https://github.com/IsaacGemal/wikitok

## Features

- **Infinite Scroll Up**: Pull (or scroll) up to fetch a brand-new, random Wikipedia article.
- **Category Scroll**: Swipe left (mobile) or click the right arrow (desktop) to scroll related articles
- **Saved Likes**: Likes are saved and exportable, and persist between windows

## Goals

- Make an functional, useful, painless app with no frameworks or external libraries
- Develop into a procedural, algorithmically curated learning tool as a proof-of-concept

## Pending Improvements

- Improve article preloading to reduce loading delay when scrolling fast
- Improve scrolling tactility on mobile
- Improve styling for mobile and desktop
- Add recommendation system based on scroll behaviors to load relevant articles
- Prioritize loading more interesting/photogenic articles
- Improve loading times
